About
---
In this projekt I try to implement the rijndael algorithm in python with the help from varius differnt resurces in the sole purpuse to understand how AES and other encryption algorithms work. Hoefully I will after this understand enough to try and write a somewhat strong encryption algorithm implementation in pythoin by my self.


Flow chart of the program structure and logic
---
Here is a flow chart representation of the of the encryption program as well as a explanation of both the logical structure and the individual functions that the porgram is building on.
