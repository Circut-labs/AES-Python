About
---
This project is a way for me to structure and work on my gymnasium project where i implment the AES encryption algohritm in python to the evaluate it and write a report about it. This project is written in pure python and do not use any external libraries for the core module "AES_Module". The project and the code is not intended for any use outside of educational and no security can be gauranteed for any encryption and/or decryption that uses this implementation. Do also not that this is not going to be the most effeicent implementation due to my limited coding skills and knowlage, but i have tried to do my best to make it as efficent as possible so itÂ´s not to slow to work with.

This implementation of AES (Advanced Encryption Algorithm) algorithm is implemented with a number of diffrent runnning modes sutch as ECB and CBC with more comming soon (see list below for updated information)...

Implemented running modes
